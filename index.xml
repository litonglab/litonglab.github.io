      <description>Project Title: Accelerating BLE Neighbor Discovery via Wi-Fi Fingerprints
Author(s): Bowen Hu，Guangjie Tu
Instructor: 李彤
[Github] Introduction
We demonstrate the design of FiND, a novel neighbor discovery protocol that accelerates BLE neighbor discovery via Wi-Fi fingerprints without any hardware modifications. The design rationale of FiND is that the two modes of WiFi and BLE show complementarity in both wireless interference and discovery pattern. When abstracting the neighbor discovery problem, this demonstration provides validation for the approach of reasoning-based presence detection in the real world.</description>

      <description>Project Title: Blender: Toward Practical Simulation Framework for BLE Neighbor Discovery
Author(s): Zhaoqi Yang, Siyuan Cao
Instructor：Tong Li
[A demo application] .
Introduction
In the widely used Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) neighbor discovery, the parameter configuration of neighbor discovery directly decides the results of the trade-off between discovery latency and power consumption. Therefore, it requires evaluating whether any given parameter configuration meets the demands. The existing solutions, however, are far from satisfactory due to unsolved issues.</description>

      <description>LitongLab Introduction Basic introduction LitongLab is a research lab led by Professor Li Tong at Renmin University of China. Our main research areas include wireless networks, wired networks, and data center networks.
Wireless networks: Wireless networks are networks that use wireless signals for communication. They are convenient, as they allow access to the network from any location without the need for cables. Wired networks: Wired networks are networks that use cables to connect devices.</description>
