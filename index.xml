      <description>Project Name: TACK
[Github] [Video and Slides] Abstract
The shared nature of the wireless medium induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgement. The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially in wireless local area network (WLAN) scenarios. In this paper, we present a new acknowledgement called TACK (&amp;ldquo;Tame ACK&amp;rdquo;), as well as its TCP implementation TCP-TACK. TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification.</description>

      <description>Project Name: Blender
[Github] [A demo application] Abstract
In the widely used Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) neighbor discovery, the parameter configuration of neighbor discovery directly decides the results of the trade-off between discovery latency and power consumption. Therefore, it requires evaluating whether any given parameter configuration meets the demands. The existing solutions, however, are far from satisfactory due to unsolved issues.
Blender, a simulation framework that produces a determined and full probabilistic distribution of discovery latency for a given parameter configuration.</description>

      <description>Project Name: FiND
[Github] Abstract
FiND is a novel neighbor discovery protocol that accelerates BLE neighbor discovery via Wi-Fi fingerprints without any hardware modifications. The design rationale of FiND is that the two modes of WiFi and BLE show complementarity in both wireless interference and discovery pattern. When abstracting the neighbor discovery problem, this demonstration provides validation for the approach of reasoning-based presence detection in the real world.

      <description>LitongLab Introduction Basic introduction LitongLab is a research lab led by Professor Li Tong at Renmin University of China. Our main research areas include wireless networks, wired networks, and data center networks.
Wireless networks: Wireless networks are networks that use wireless signals for communication. They are convenient, as they allow access to the network from any location without the need for cables. Wired networks: Wired networks are networks that use cables to connect devices.</description>
