[{"content":"Project Name: TACK\n[Github] [Video and Slides] Abstract\nThe shared nature of the wireless medium induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgement. The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially in wireless local area network (WLAN) scenarios. In this paper, we present a new acknowledgement called TACK (\u0026ldquo;Tame ACK\u0026rdquo;), as well as its TCP implementation TCP-TACK. TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification. To minimize ACK frequency, TACK abandons the legacy received-packet-driven ACK. Instead, it balances byte-counting ACK and periodic ACK so as to achieve a controlled ACK frequency. Evaluation results show that TCP-TACK achieves significant advantages over legacy TCP in WLAN scenarios due to less contention between data packets and ACKs. Specifically, TCP-TACK reduces over 90% of ACKs and also obtains an improvement of ∼28% on goodput. We further find it performs equally well as high-speed TCP variants in wide area network (WAN) scenarios, this is attributed to the advancements of the TACK-based protocol design in loss recovery, round-trip timing, and send rate control.\nReference\nTong Li, Kai Zheng, Ke Xu, Rahul Arvind Jadhav, Tao Xiong, Keith Winstein, Kun Tan.

However, our production network measurement studies show that the legacy loss recovery is far from satisfactory due to the wide-area loss characteristics (i.e., dynamics and burstiness) in the wild. In this paper, we propose a sender-side Adaptive ReTransmission scheme, ART, which minimizes the recovery time of lost packets with minimal redundancy cost. Distinguishing itself from forward- error-correction (FEC), which preemptively sends redundant data packets to prevent loss, ART functions as an automatic- repeat-request (ARQ) scheme. It applies redundancy specifically to lost packets instead of unlost packets, thereby addressing the characteristic patterns of wide-area losses in real-world scenarios. We implement ART upon QUIC protocol and evaluate it via both trace-driven emulation and real-world deployment. The results show that ART reduces up to 34% of flow completion time (FCT) for delay-sensitive transmissions, improves up to 28% of goodput for throughput-intensive transmissions, and saves up to 90% of redundancy cost.\nReference\nTong Li, Wei Liu, Xinyu Ma, Shuaipeng Zhu, Jinkun Cao, Senzhen Liu, Taotao Zhang, Yinfeng Zhu, Bo Wu, Ke Xu.

Our main research areas include wireless networks, wired networks, and data center networks.\nWireless networks: Wireless networks are networks that use wireless signals for communication. They are convenient, as they allow access to the network from any location without the need for cables. Wired networks: Wired networks are networks that use cables to connect devices. They have the advantage of high speeds and low data transmission delays. Data center networks: Data center networks are networks established for data centers. A data center is a computer system used for storing, processing, and managing large amounts of data. The main purpose of a data center network is to ensure fast data transfer and processing for large amounts of data. Composition of members Currently, we have one teacher and 6 master\u0026rsquo;s students, as well as 13 undergraduate students, for a total of 20 people. We are dedicated to studying and working hard to contribute to the development of the field of networks.\nOur lab is equipped with the latest computer network equipment and software, and has professional technical personnel to provide guidance.
